## Why did I choose IndexedDB?

- I have worked decent enough on local storage, and wanted to explore the IndexedDB API.
- Asynchronous - hence migrating to real database is easier.
- I don't like using `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` methods just to store the data.

**PS:** IndexedDB has more storage limit than `localStorage` (our simple application doesn't need to worry about it any way ðŸ˜œ)
